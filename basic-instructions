to run this proj - npm run start

test deploy changes - 

(first time)
1- firebase login
2- firebase init
 What do you want to use as your public directory? build
  ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
  ? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
  ? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? Yes

3- npm run build
4- firebase deploy

You only need to do Step #1 (login) the first time when you setup building on that machine (or maybe when a new firebase revision has been released)

You only need to do Step #2 (init) to initialize a new project. That is, when you don't have your firebase.json yet (which will be created by the init command).

To re-deploy, it's simply:

npm run build (delete old build folder first)
firebase deploy

add to git - 

git pull
git add -A (push new files, changes only)
git commit -m "added logo"
git push -u origin main
